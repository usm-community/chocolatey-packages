## Arduino IDE (Portable)

This package Unzip Arduino IDE in the "C:\ProgramFiles\Aduino IDE" folder, thus making the software accessible to all users.

Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple I/O board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing and MaxMSP). The boards can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled; the open-source IDE can be downloaded for free at https://arduino.cc
