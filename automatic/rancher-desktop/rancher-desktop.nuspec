    <summary>Rancher Desktop is an open-source project that brings Kubernetes and container management to the desktop</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[## Kubernetes and Container Management on the Desktop
Rancher Desktop runs Kubernetes and container management on your desktop. You can choose the version of Kubernetes you want to run. You can build, push, pull, and run container images using either containerd or Moby (dockerd). The container images you build can be run by Kubernetes immediately without the need for a registry.


### Container Management

Container management to build, push, and pull images and run containers. It uses the same container runtime as Kubernetes. Built images are immediately available to use in your local workloads without any pushing, pulling, or copying.

### Kubernetes Made Simple

Getting started with Kubernetes on your desktop can be a project. Especially if you want to match the version of Kubernetes you run locally to the one you run in production. Rancher Desktop makes it as easy as setting a preference.

### Built On Proven Projects

Rancher Desktop leverages proven projects to do the dirty work. That includes Moby, containerd, k3s, kubectl, and more. These projects have demonstrated themselves as trustworthy and provide a foundation you can trust.
